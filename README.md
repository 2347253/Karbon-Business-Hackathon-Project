# Financial Analysis Model and Web Application

This project is a two-part challenge that involves building a financial analysis model and creating a web application to utilize the model.

---

## 📖 Problem Statement

### **Module 1 - Financial Analysis Model (1 Hour)**

Create a simple financial analysis model using the following files:

1. **rules.py**: Contains predefined rules for financial analysis. You are required to implement the functions as per the comments provided. The example function `latest_financial_index` serves as a reference.
2. **model.py**: Processes the rules from `rules.py` and outputs results in JSON format.
3. **data.json**: Sample dataset used as input for the analysis model.

### **Module 2 - Web Application (30 Minutes)**

Develop a web application using the framework or tool of your choice. The application consists of two pages:

1. **Page 1: Upload Data**  
   - Allows users to upload the `data.json` file.  
   - On submission, processes the file using the model created in **Module 1** and displays the results in JSON format.

2. **Page 2: Results**  
   - Displays the results obtained from `model.py` in a structured and interactive manner.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Financial Analysis Model**  
   - Evaluates multiple financial metrics using rules defined in `rules.py`.  
   - Flags include:  
     - **TOTAL_REVENUE_5CR_FLAG**: Checks if total revenue exceeds ₹5 crore.  
     - **BORROWING_TO_REVENUE_FLAG**: Verifies if the borrowing-to-revenue ratio is healthy.  
     - **ISCR_FLAG**: Evaluates the Interest Service Coverage Ratio (ISCR).  

2. **Interactive Web Application**  
   - **Upload Financial Data**: Upload the financial dataset and process it.  
   - **Detailed Results**: View flags, insights, and visualizations of financial trends.  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Displays trends in net revenue using interactive line charts with Plotly.
